<h1>Deadpool (Wade Winston Wilson) is a fictional antihero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
 Created by artist/writer Rob Liefeld and writer Fabian Nicieza, the character first appeared in The New Mutants #98 
 (cover-dated February 1991). Initially Deadpool was depicted as a supervillain when he made his first appearance in
 The New Mutants and later in issues of X-Force, but later evolved into his more recognizable antiheroic persona. Deadpool,
 whose real name is Wade Wilson, is a disfigured and mentally unstable mercenary with the superhuman ability of an 
 accelerated healing factor and physical prowess. The character is known as the "Merc with a Mouth" because of his 
 talkative nature and tendency to break the fourth wall, which is used by writers for humorous effect and running gags.
The character's popularity has seen him feature in numerous other media. In the 2004 series Cable & Deadpool, 
he refers to his own scarred appearance as "Ryan Reynolds crossed with a Shar Pei".[6][7] Reynolds himself would 
eventually portray the character in the 2009 film X-Men Origins: Wolverine and reprised the role in the 2016 film Deadpool.
